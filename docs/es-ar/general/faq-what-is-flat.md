## The story behind Flat

Our team launched Flat in 2015. We were using Google Docs and at the same time sending sheet music by email. We thought that we should create an equivalent for music notation: Collaborative with real-time edition across devices, really easy to use yet powerful to use with a simple interface, accessible by anyone. That's why we created Flat (â™­), the first easy-to-use and multi-platform music notation editor.
