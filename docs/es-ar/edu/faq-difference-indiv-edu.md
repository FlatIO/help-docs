An [individual account](https://flat.io) is great to quickly get started alone or with some collaborators to make music scores and be able to edit them together in real-time.

Our [education organizations](https://flat.io/edu) are designed for teachers and students who want dedicated and private workspaces for their classes or groups of students. Each workspace allows you to share music scores with a group of students, embed external educational resources, create musical activities/assignments with the ability to easily provide feedback, and much more! To learn more about Flat for Education, [visit our dedicated website](https://flat.io/edu)!
