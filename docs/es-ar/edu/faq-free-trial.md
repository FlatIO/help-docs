We know that teachers need time to discover and try new products, that's why we offer **a 90-days free trial for all education accounts**. You can quickly create your Flat for Education account at [https://flat.io/edu/signup](https://flat.io/edu/signup).

If you need more time to try Flat with your students, or want to organize a pilot for your school or district, or simple have some questions or feedback please contact our team at [edu@flat.io](mailto:edu@flat.io). We look forward to hearing from you!
