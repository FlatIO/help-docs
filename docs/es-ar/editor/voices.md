## Using voices on Flat

To add multiple of different durations that play at the same time in a single staff, you can use multiple voices. For string instruments in an orchestra, you can also use this feature to write a *divisi*.

To add a second voice in your measure, click on the **Voice button** on the left the toolbars, then choose "**Voice 2**". Use the same button to toggle between voices and remove one voice. If you use keyboard shortcuts, you can also press **v** to toggle your voices.
