## Purpose

The enharmonic switch is used to change the selected notehead for another one that has the same sound. For instance C and B# has the same sound. So are D# and Eb. You can use this tool when you are inputing notes from the TAB staff, to get the visual display you want. 

As you can see on the image below, the two notes are playing on the same string/fret.
