The metronome is available for all accounts in our editor and public viewer. By default, the metronome is setup in mode "Count-in" (aka "Rolling"), which mean it will only play before the playback starts.

## Metronome Mode

You can change the mode of the metronome by clicking on the metronome icon next to the Play button, and choose one of the three available modes:

* Count-in (Rolling)
* Always On
* Always Off
