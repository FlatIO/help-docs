You can update your billing information online anytime. Check out below how based on your current payment method

## I paid by card, and I want to update it

You can access [your billing settings online at flat.io](https://flat.io/settings/account/billing). To do so:

* Sign in to flat.io.
* Click your profile picture in the upper right corner.
* Click **Account settings**.
* On the left menu, choose **Billing**
* From there you can update your card, and update your billing address if you are [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) customer.

If you can't update your billing information, [please contact us](https://flat.io/help/support).

## I paid by PayPal

If you paid by PayPal, you can directly update your payment means [in your PayPal account](https://www.paypal.com). You can adjust the funding source for your subscription [in the pre-approved payments settings](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/customerprofileweb?cmd=_manage-paylist).

## Purchased Flat on the Apple App Store?

If you bought a subscription from an Apple device, you'll need to [update your billing information through iTunes](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201266).
