## Get started with Flat for Docs

You don't need a Flat account to create the music notation and, simply open our free add-on, enter your notation and click on "Insert". If you need help regarding the editor, [check out the dedicated help](/help/en/music-notation-software/). This add-on is a lite version of our [web-based & collaborative notation software](https://flat.io), and doesn't include all the options available in our dedicated tool.

## How the notation tools work?

You can discover all the tools available [on this dedicated help page](/help/en/music-notation-software/notation-features.html), and how to use them.

## How to edit the music notation?

To edit your inserted notation, select the picture and re-open the add-on. To validate the changes and insert the updated music notation, click on the button *Edit*.

## How to play my music?

The notation inserted in your document works like a picture and doesn't have our playback included (you can still play it later, simply select the inserted image and open the add-on again). If you would like to see audio/sounds included in Google Docs/Slides in the future, feel free send a feature request to their product teams (Help > Docs Help > Send feedback).
