You don't need a Flat account to create the music notation and, simply open our free add-on, enter your notation and click on "Insert". If you need help regarding the editor, [check out the dedicated help](/help/en/music-notation-software/). This add-on is a lite version of our [web-based & collaborative notation software](https://flat.io), and doesn't include all the options available in our dedicated tool.

The notation inserted in your document works like a picture and doesn't have our playback included (you can still play it later, simply select the inserted image and open the add-on again). If you would like to see audio/sounds included in Google Docs/Slides in the future, feel free send a feature request to their product teams (Help > Docs Help > Send feedback).

**If you need help regarding this add-on, please contact us at [google-docs@flat.io](mailto:google-docs@flat.io)**. If you like it, please give us a review on the store and share it to your friends!
