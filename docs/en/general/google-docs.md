## Install the add-ons

The add-ons are available on the [G Suite Marketplace](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/flat_for_docs/324260072797). [Click here to install them](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/flat_for_docs/324260072797) in your Google Account.

Then, in Docs and Slides, click on **Add-ons > Flat > Insert musical snippet** to open the add-on.

## Get started with Flat for Docs

You don't need a Flat account to create the music notation and, simply open our free add-on, enter your notation and click on "Insert". If you need help regarding the editor, [check out the dedicated help](/help/en/music-notation-software/). This add-on is a lite version of our [web-based & collaborative notation software](https://flat.io), and doesn't include all the options available in our dedicated tool.

## How the notation tools work?

You can discover all the tools available [on this dedicated help page](/help/en/music-notation-software/notation-features.html), and how to use them.

## How to edit the music notation?

To edit your inserted notation, select the picture and re-open the add-on. To validate the changes and insert the updated music notation, click on the button *Edit*.

## How to play my music?

The notation inserted in your document works like a picture and doesn't have our playback included (you can still play it later, simply select the inserted image and open the add-on again). If you would like to see audio/sounds included in Google Docs/Slides in the future, feel free send a feature request to their product teams (Help > Docs Help > Send feedback).

That's it, you can now use the add-on.

## Known issues with the Google Docs add-ons

### Cannot edit an existing Snippet

At this time we store the original score file in the Google Docs, which has a small storage capacity for the add-ons. Since the add-on is designed for small snippets, you won't be able to modify large snippets once inserted or if you have a lot of snippets in a single document. That's something we plan to improve in a future release by changing the way we store the original scores.

### Brave Browser

The add-ons won't work with the Fingerprinting Protection Mode. Our code runs as a third-party in Google Docs and uses some SVG and Canvas features to export your score into an image in Docs, which is blocked by Brave by default. You can temporary disable the Fingerprinting Protection when working with the add-ons.
