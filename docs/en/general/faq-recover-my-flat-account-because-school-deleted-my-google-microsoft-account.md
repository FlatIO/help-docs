If you used our Google Sign in or Microsoft Sign in using your school email and your school deleted the associated account, you will lose access to your Flat account. Here is the process to recover it:

* First, [create a new Flat individual account](https://flat.io/auth/signup) with a personal email address (e.g. a GMail account)
* Then you [need to contact our team by email](mailto:hello@flat.io) from this personal email. In this email, please indicate the email address of your deactivated Google/Microsoft account, and if possible some additional information regarding your previous account.
* We will then manually review your request. If this one is legit and it's possible to recover your account, we will transfer your files from your previous Flat account and delete it.
