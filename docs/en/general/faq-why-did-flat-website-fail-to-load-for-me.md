There are several reasons why our website can fail to load. Here are the two main ones:

* This is **a temporary failure from your local network, WIFI or ISP** (Internet Service Provider). In this case, try reloading the website using Ctrl + Shift + R (or Cmd + Shift + R on Mac OS) to be sure the page is completely reloaded.
* Your **school is blocking our website, partially or completely**. If your organization is using a firewall, please make sure that all of domain names are authorized. If you are not sure, please contact your IT and [provide them our domains list to authorize](/help/en/general/data-infrastructure.html#domain-names). If you are using a device provided by your school, our website might not be authorized even you are trying to connect on a different network.

If you need additional support, [please contact our support team](/help/support).
