## Native app

If you are using an iOS device (iPhone or iPad), we have a native app [available on the App Store](https://flat.io/ios). Feel free to leave us a review if you like it, or [contact our support team](mailto:ios@flat.io) if you have any issues or questions. We have plans to develop a native app for Android as well, stay tuned!

Discover a quick demo of our iOS app below:

## Progressive Web App

Flat also perfectly works as a mobile web app that you can use online and offline. Simply open [flat.io](https://flat.io) in your preferred mobile web browser and sign in with your Flat account to use it.
