Our platform uses multiple cloud providers and subprocessors to run Flat. To provide the best performances, security, and service, these providers and datacenters are located in multiple countries. We also replicate data across multiple countries.

## Domain names

If you're using restrictive firewall or proxy server settings, you or your network admin will need to allow (whitelist) certain domains to ensure Flat and related services work as expected.

Allow these domains for Flat and related services:

```
