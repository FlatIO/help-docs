The [new Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) allows you to embed any custom HTML code. That's a good opportunity to embed interactive sheet music on your own website!


## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert your Flat score in your Google Site, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy our HTML code

To copy the HTML code of our embed into your clipboard, click on "*Share*" in our editor our public viewer, then choose "*Embed*", you will arrive on [our embed generator](https://flat.io/developers/embed/generator):

## 3. Get the best display of your notation

To get the best display of the interactive notation in your Google Sites, we advise you to adjust the *height* of the embed to **100%**. Using this option, you will be able to easily adjust the embed size directly in Google Sites when adding your content.

Then click on "*Copy HTML code*" on the top of the generator page.

## 3. Insert into your Google Site

To insert the notation into Google Sites, choose *Insert > Embed* on the right of your screen:

Then choose *Custom code* and paste the previously code, and click on *Next* and *Insert*:

You can then adjust the size of the score, your music notation will magically fit the size you choose. This is great if you want to add, for example, some text or another media beside your notation.
