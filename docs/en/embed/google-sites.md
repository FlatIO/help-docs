The [new Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) allows you to embed any custom HTML code. That's a good opportunity to embed interactive sheet music on your own website!


## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert your Flat score in your Google Site, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy the music score link

To embed your sheet music, you will need to either make the score public on the Internet or get a private sharing link.

### Public score 

If the score is public, simply copy its link in your browser address bar:

### Private score

If the score is private, click on "*Collaborate*", then "*Copy the sharing link*". This will generate a private sharing link and copy it to your clipboard.

## 3. Insert into your Google Site

To insert the notation into Google Sites, choose *Insert > Embed* on the right of your screen:

Then paste the link to your score, and click on *Insert*:

You can then adjust the size of the score, your music notation will magically fit the size you choose. This is great if you want to add, for example, some text or another media beside your notation.
