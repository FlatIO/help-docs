Medium allows you to easily embed a Flat music notation, discover how in this page.

## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert the Flat score into your Medium blog post, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy the music score link

To embed your sheet music, you will need to either make the score public on the Internet or get a private sharing link.

### Public score 

If the score is public, simply copy its link in your browser address bar:

### Private score

If the score is private, click on "*Collaborate*", then "*Copy the sharing link*". This will generate a private sharing link and copy it to your clipboard.
