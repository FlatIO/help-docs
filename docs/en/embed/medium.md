Medium allows you to easily embed a Flat music notation, discover how in this page.

## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert the Flat score into your Medium blog post, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy the music score link

To get the link to your sheet music, go to the *My library* or the *Score Editor*, click on *Share* and choose *Copy private shareable link*.
