[Microsoft Sway](https://sway.com/) allows you to embed some authorized tools and resources in your presentations and documents, and Flat is one of them! That's a good opportunity to embed interactive sheet music in your presentations.

## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert your Flat score in your Sway document, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy our HTML code

To copy the HTML code of our embed into your clipboard, click on "*Share*" in our editor our public viewer, then choose "*Embed*", you will arrive on [our embed generator](https://flat.io/developers/embed/generator):

## 3. Get the best display of your notation

To get the best display of the interactive notation in your Sway, we advise you to adjust the *height* of the embed to **100%**. Using this option, you will be able to easily adjust the embed size directly in Sway when adding your content.

Then click on "*Copy HTML code*" on the top of the generator page.

## 3. Insert into your Sway

To insert the notation into Sway, click on **+**, choose **Media** and **Embed**.
