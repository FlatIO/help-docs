## Measures Numbers Policy

Under the **Measures Numbers** settings, you can choose how the measures numbers are printed. By default, we print them at every system, but you can choose to print them at every measure or simply hide them.

## Start numbering after an anacrusis

If you have [an anacusis in your score](/help/en/music-notation-software/timesig.html#pickup-anacrusis) and want to start numbering the measures after the anacrusis, you can activate the option that will shift the measures numbers.

## Custom measures numbers

When you work on multi-files projects (e.g. with multiple movements), you might want to have your measures numbering to start at a greater measure number than 1.

In the **Measure Numbers** block, you can choose to start the numbering at a different number by enabling **Start numbering at ...**.
