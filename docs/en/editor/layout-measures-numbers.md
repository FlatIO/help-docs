To customize the measures numbers policy, **open the Layout Settings, next to the print button**.

On our desktop web app, this is usually located on the right of your screen, or in the "Document" toolbar. On our mobile app, click on the edit button on the top of your screen.

## Measures Numbers Policy

Under the **Measures Numbers** settings, you can choose how the measures numbers are printed. By default, we print them at every system, but you can choose to print them at every measure or simply hide them.

If you have [an anacusis in your score](/help/en/music-notation-software/timesig.html#pickup-anacrusis) and want to start numbering the measures after the anacrusis, you can activate the option that will shift the measures numbers.
