Once you created a score, you can rename the parts in the document settings. To manage the instruments and part settings, click on the instrument button on the left on the toolbar, then click on "**Manage instruments**".

Then click on the "**Edit**" button next to the part you want to edit. You can also directly click on a part name if this one is displayed to open this same page.

You can then change the staves: adding new ones and removing existing staves. Click on "**Staves**", then click on "**Add a new stave for this instrument**, or on the remove icon next to an existing stave.
