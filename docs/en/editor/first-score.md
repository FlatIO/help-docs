To create your first music score with Flat and get starting writing your music notation or tabs, [create a free account on our platform](https://flat.io).

## 1. Open the score creation tool

Once you are logged in to Flat, click on the button ["New music score"](https://flat.io/score?m=newscore) on your main dashboard page, or the icon available in the navigation on the top right of your screen on any dashboard page.

## 2. Choose the document title or import a MusicXML/MIDI file

You now have the window opened to create your document, choose a title for this one, or click on the Import button to import an existing file to Flat.

**Import**: At this time, we support **MusicXML (*.xml / *.mxl) and MIDI** files. If you are using another software, you should be able to export your files to one of these formats (we recommend you to export them as MusicXML, so you will have the exact music notation imported to Flat).

## 3. Add the instruments

Last step, choose the different instruments you want to add to this document. We have today over 100 instruments available, sorted into different categories.

**Tablatures**: If you choose a plucked string instrument, by default we will add a tablature to this one. You can disable this feature on the top of the instruments listing.
