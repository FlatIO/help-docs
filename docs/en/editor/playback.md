Flat integrates a great playback that interprets your sheet music directly in your web browser, without any plugins. Discover here [how to use it](#use-the-playback), [change the volume](#change-the-volume), the [instruments' reverb](#customize-the-instruments-reverb), [swing](#enable-the-swing) and [use our metronome](#change-the-metronome-mode).

## Implementation notes

Our goal is to provide a good trade-off between performance and interpretation quality, so it can work well even with a low amount of memory (you might not have the best experience with a large number of instruments).

At this time, most of the notations are interpreted, except:

* Accelerando/Ritardendo
* Mordents
* Turn
* Snap pizzicato
* Bowing Directions
* Text
