Flat integrates a great playback that interprets your sheet music directly in your web browser, without any plugins. Discover here [how to use it](#use-the-playback), [change the volume](#change-the-volume), the [instruments' reverb](#customize-the-instruments-reverb), [swing](#enable-the-swing) and [use our metronome](/help/en/music-notation-software/metronome.html).

## Implementation notes

Our goal is to provide a good trade-off between performance and interpretation quality, so it can work well even with a low amount of memory (you might not have the best experience with a large number of instruments).

At this time, most of the notations are interpreted, except:

* Accelerando / Ritardendo
* Snap pizzicato
* Bowing Directions
* Palm mute / Left ring
* Text

## Use the Playback

{% include_relative generated/player.md %}

## Change the volume

{% include_relative generated/volume.md %}

## Customize the instruments' reverb

{% include_relative generated/reverb.md %}

## Change the playback speed

You can find how to change the global playback speed on [our dedicated help page](/help/en/music-notation-software/playback-speed.html).

## Enable the swing

The swing includes the notation and the playback interpretation. Discover how to use it [in our dedicated help page](/help/en/music-notation-software/swing.html).
