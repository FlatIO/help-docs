## What are the lyrics?

Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. On Flat, you can easily write lyrics under your notation using our Lyric tool, available in the Text toolbar.

## Getting started with Lyrics on Flat

To start writing lyrics under your music notation, focus the note where you want to start adding your lyrics, then open the "Text" toolbar and click on the Lyrics icon.

You can input lyrics like regular text, pressing space will go to the next note or rest.

## Multiple words on the same note

If you want to have two or more lyrics words attached to the same note, you need to use `shift+space` in order to insert and espace, instead of moving to the next note. 

### Syllable

If you have a word that spans on several notes, you can have a syllable on each note, and connected them by pressing `-` instead of the spacebar.

### Melisma

If you have a syllable/vowel that spans over several notes, you can add a melisma with the underscore `_`. First write the syllable, press `_`. Then press it again for each note on which you want to extend the 
melisma.
