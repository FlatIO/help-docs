## Slash section

A slash section is uses when you want to give leberty to improvise to the performer. The slashes in the measuers follow the meter, and there are chords indications above some slashes to indicate which notes to use for improvisation.

## Rhythmic notation

If you want more granularity on the rhythm of the slashes, you can use the rhythmic notation instead.

When you are in the rhythmic mode, you can add/remove slash the same way you are adding notes, and you can change the notes/slashes durations.

At the moment we do not provide yet the playback for the chords with the slash/rhythmic section, 
but it will be introduced in a future version.
