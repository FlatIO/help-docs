## Purpose

The coda section is usually played at the end of the score. When the rest of the score has been played, there is a **to coda** marking, that indicate the player has to jump to the coda section. The coda section starts on a new system. 

## Add a coda marking

You can add the Coda marking by going to the **"Measure" toolbar**. Select the first measure of the coda section, then click on the coda button. If there is already a **Segno** in this measure, it will be replaced by the **Coda**.
