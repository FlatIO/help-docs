You can customize [the editor shortcuts](/help/en/music-notation-software/keyboard-shortcuts.html) directly in the music notation editor.

<div class="p">To view existing shortcuts and edit them, open a score, then press <div class="kbs"><div class="kb-container"><div class="kb">Alt</div><div class="kb-plus">+</div><div class="kb">?</div></div></div>, or click on the "?" icon on the top right of the editor, then click on the <strong>Customize</strong> button on the bottom of the shortcut dialog.</div>

From there you can **add new keyboard shortcuts** or **editing existing keyboard shortcuts**.

For new keyboard shortcuts, you can **pick up an action among hundreds of actions available**. Actions that take a variable input can't be used at this time with a keyboard shortcut (e.g. pitched notes, transpositions). If you are looking for an action that is not available in the list, [please let us know what you want to use, we regularly add new actions](/help/support).

When adding actions that are **specific to pitched instruments, tabs or unpitched instruments**, you can re-use the same keys for a different context, they will only be active in the context they can be used.

By customizing your shortcuts, **you will also get future shortcuts updates made by our team**, except if your shortcuts are using the same keys than our default config. In this case, your shortcuts will have priority over our default config.

You **can reset the keyboard shortcuts anytime** if you want to come back to the original config.
