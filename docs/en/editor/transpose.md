## Transpose a complete part for a different instrument

The easiest way to transpose a complete score part for another instrument is to replace the configuration of the part with the instrument you want to use. Replacing an instrument will take care of any needed transposition, and will also change the sound of the playback and other settings.

Some examples when you can use this feature:
* You have a **Violin** part and want to transpose it for a **Trumpet in Bb**.
* You have a transposed part for a **Trumpet in Bb** and want to have the part for **Violin**.
* You have a transposed part for a **Trumpet in Bb** and want to transpose it for an **Alto Saxophone**.

To transpose your part, go to the instruments settings by clicking the instrument button on the left on the toolbar, then click on "**Manage instruments**".

Then click on the "**Replace**" button next to the part you want to transpose, and choose the instrument you want to use. If the previous or the chosen instrument is a transposing instrument, the part will be transposed for the new instrument.

If your initial part doesn't have the good transposition configuration, you can use the transposition feature below to apply a custom transposition on the part.

You can transpose a selection of notes by **Interval**, **Key**, or **Semi-tones** using our transposition tool available in the note toolbar. This tool works with a selection made in a single or multiple parts.

If you don't make a selection before using the transposition tool, the transposition will be applied to the complete part where your cursor is located.
