The term "concert pitch" is used to distinguish between the "written" (or "nominal"), and "sounding" (or "real") notes of a transposing instrument.

When you open a score on Flat and this one has a transposing instrument, we display these part using the "written" notes of the instruments. To display the "sounding" notes of the instrument (in concert pitch), you can click on the **Concert Pitch icon** on the **Note toolbar**.

The transposition configuration of an instrument is automatically set when you add the part to the score. If you want to transpose a part from one instrument to another one, you can [replace the instrument configuration](/help/en/music-notation-software/transpose.html#transpose-a-complete-part-for-a-different-instrument). You can also [create your own instrument configuration with a custom transposition](/help/en/music-notation-software/custom-instruments.html#pitched-instruments) and save it in your Flat account.
