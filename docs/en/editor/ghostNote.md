## What are ghost notes?

In music theory, a ghost note should be muted or soften when played. Usually, it has no distinctive pitch and is used to add a rhythmic value to the score. In music notation, the ghost note is represented by an “X” or in brackets for the note head.

## Add a grace note on Flat

Select the note you want to ghost, then go to the "Note" toolbar and click on the ghost note tool, symbolized by a note head in brackets. To transform a ghost note into a regular note, use the same icon in the toolbar.
