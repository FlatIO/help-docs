Flat allows you to display Kodály notation, that is generated directly from the content of your score. 

## Enabling Kodály notation

To enable Kodály notation, you need to open **the instrument settings**. You can do so by clicking on the instrument button on the left on the toolbar, then click on “Manage instruments”. You can also click on the instrument name on the score.

From there, you can configurate the Kodály notation:

### Display type
You can either choose to display notes as letters (do re mi fa so la ti), or as hand signs.

### Source singing pitch & Recommended singing pitch
The source singing pitch is the "original" pitch of the song.
The recommended singing pitch is the pitch that will be used for students to sing the song. 

The Kodály notation is automatically transposed based on the source and recommended singing pitch. 
On this example, the source singing pitch is "C", and the recommended singing pitch is "G":

## Printing
When you print the score, you will probably want to get rid of the normal staff, to only keep the Kodály notation. To do so, just tick the "Only print Kodály" checkbox.

Here is the result, with only the Kodály notation:
