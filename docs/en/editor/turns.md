## What is a turn?

A Turn is an ornament symbolized by a liying *S* above the staff for a regular one, and crossed by an oblique line when inverted. 
When played, a turn should start with the note above the base note, followed by the principal note, then the one below, and ends on the main note. For inverted turns, the musician should start with the note below the written one. 
The duration of a turn should not be longer than the rhythmic value of the main note. 

## How to add or remove a turn?

First, select the desired note. Then, in the Ornament toolbar, click on the Turn icon. You can either add a regular turn or an inverted one.
