## Purpose

The repeat ending is used with the **repeat barlines**. Here is the typical usecase. The player play the measures between the repeat barline a first time, playing the measure under the "1". Then when playing for the second time, the performer will skip the measures under the "1" to play the measures under the "2". It is possible to combine those, to make a group of measures played several times, or two change several times the measures played at the end of a repeat section.
