Flat offers a large [set of actions](/help/en/music-notation-software/notation-features.html) that you can perform. At some point, it can become simpler to apply these actions. Here's how to do a perfect range selection.

## Using the Mouse

The logic behind is pretty much the same as you can find on any well known text editor. To start a selection hold the mouseleft button.
Keep the mouseleft button hold and move your mouse to the end of the selection you want to set.
That's all you can now [copy / paste](/help/en/music-notation-software/paste.html) for example.

## Using the Keyboard

Again the logic behind is pretty close to text editors. When you start to hold shift a virtual "anchor" will be placed where your cursor is. Then using the keyboard arrows you will be able to move the cursor around and create a range.

⇠ | Extend the range to left
⇢ | Extend the range to the right
⇡ | Extend the range to the upper stave or part
⇣ | Extend the range to the lower stave or part
