## Notes duration basics

Changing the head, adding a flag, or remove the stem from a given note, alter the duration of this one. 
Usually, the Quarter Note, corresponds to one beat music note. A Half Note will multiply its duration by two and a Hole Note by four. On the contrary, adding a flag divides the duration of the quarter note by two. 

## Changing the duration of a note or rest on Flat

Select the note or rest that you want to modify, then go to the *Note* toolbar. Choose any duration you want, from the whole note to the sixty-fourth note. The tools to change the duration of a note or a rest are unified and have the same icons in the toolbar so you can change the duration before or after adding a note.
