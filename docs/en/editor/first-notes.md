Once you [created your first score](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html) and [set a time and key signature to your score](/help/en/music-notation-software/tutorial-key-time-signature.html), you can now start adding your first notes.

## Measures are always filled with Notes or Rests

On Flat **the measures are always filled with notes or rests to match the time signature**. This means that inserting a note will remove a rest from the same duration, and removing a note will put back a rest. This also means that the duration tools available in the *Note* toolbar can be used for the notes and the rests.

## Adding notes

You can input notes and notation using your [Mouse](#mouse-or-touchpad), [Device Keyboard](#device-keyboard), [Touchscreen](#touchscreen), and [MIDI devices](#midi-devices), discover how on this page.

**If you are using Tabs, you can also check out this dedicated page for tablatures.**

### Mouse or Touchpad

To input notes using your Mouse, put the blue cursor where you want to add the note, choose the pitch by putting your cursor over the stave, then click on it to insert the note.

### Device Keyboard

To insert notes faster with your computer, you can use keyboard shortcuts. You can insert your first notes using the **A to G** letters on your keyboard, change the durations using **1 to 7** on your keypad, and arrows to move in your scores.
