Before adding the first notes on your score, it's best to set the correct time and key signatures.

## Change the Time Signature

The first concept to know is that **you can click on all the existing elements** of your music notation. So if you want to change the clef or existing, **click on it and directly to make the modification**:

All the tools are also **available in different toolbars**. So for example, **you can also change the time signature from the *Measure* toolbar**, as shown below. That's also a good way to insert a new time signature when there is no existing one.

## Insert a new Key Signature

By default, the score is in *C major*, so there is no key signature printed on the score. To insert a new key signature, go to the *Measure* toolbar and choose the new key signature to use.
