Flat provides more than 100 instruments to everyone (Free, Power, and Education accounts), discover here how to use them, [customize them in a score](#changing-instruments-in-a-score), and create [your own instruments configurations](/help/en/music-notation-software/custom-instruments.html).

## Score creation

When creating a new score, you have the option to add one or multiple instruments, from our provided list or [your own custom instruments](/help/en/music-notation-software/custom-instruments.html).

The chosen instruments are displayed on the right of the screen, they will be added to the score in the displayed order. You can drag and drop them to sort them.

[![Add the instruments](/help/assets/img/editor/create-score-instruments.png)](https://flat.io/my-library?m=newscore)

If you want to create a TAB, check the displayed option "Tabs mode". Tablatures can also be turned on or off later in the instruments settings ([see below](#changing-instruments-in-a-score)).

## Changing instruments in a score

Instruments can easily be modified in an existing score. To open the instruments settings, click on a name of a part or on "*Manage instruments*" on the left of the toolbar.

The instruments configuration window allows you to:

* [**Add, remove, or change the order** of the instruments](/help/en/music-notation-software/instruments-add-remove-order.html).
* [Change the **name of a part and the abbreviation**](/help/en/music-notation-software/instruments-rename.html).
* **Replace** an instrument with another one. This will replace all the settings of the instrument with the new one. If the original or the new instrument is a transposing instrument, [this will automatically transpose the part for you to the new transposition mode](/help/en/music-notation-software/transpose.html#transpose-a-complete-part-for-a-different-instrument).
* **Add or remove staves** of an instrument, by clicking on the arrow on the right of the part name.
* **Enabling/disable TAB** for an instrument and **customize the tuning** of an instrument.

## Create custom instruments

You can use custom instruments configurations to create and save personnalized instruments configurations in your account. This allows you to quickly re-use configurations without having to manually set the parameters to every score you create.

This includes:

* **[Pitched instruments](/help/en/music-notation-software/custom-instruments.html#pitched-instruments)**: Staves, Clefs, Transposition, Tablature, Tuning, Sound, Part name and abbreviation.
* **[Unpitched instruments](/help/en/music-notation-software/custom-instruments.html#unpitched-instruments)**: Number of staves lines, the different percussion instruments, their places and heads on the staves, and custom keyboard shortcuts to input the notes.
