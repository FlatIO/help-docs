Flat provides more than 100 instruments to everyone (Free, Power, and Education accounts), discover here how to use them, [customize them in a score](#changing-instruments-in-a-score), and create [your own instruments configurations](#create-custom-instruments).

## Score creation

When creating a new score, you have the option to add one or multiple instruments, from our provided list or [your own custom instruments](#create-custom-instruments)

The chosen instruments are displayed on the right of the screen, they will be added to the score in the displayed order. You can drag and drop them to sort them.

[![Add the instruments](/help/assets/img/editor/create-score-instruments.png)](https://flat.io/score?m=newscore)

If you want to create a TAB, check the displayed option "Tabs mode". Tablatures can also be turned on or off later in the instruments settings ([see below](#changing-instruments-in-a-score)).

## Changing instruments in a score

Instruments can easily be modified in an existing score. To open the instruments settings, click on a name of a part or on "*Manage instruments*" on the left of the toolbar.

The instruments configuration window allows you to:

* **Add, remove, or change the order** of the instruments.
* Change the **name of a part and the abbreviation**.
* **Replace** an instrument with another one. This will replace all the settings of the instrument with the new one. If the original or the new instrument is a transposing instrument, this will automatically transpose the part for you to the new transposition mode.
* **Add or remove staves** of an instrument, by clicking on the arrow on the right of the part name.
* **Enabling/disable TAB** for an instrument and **customize the tuning** of an instrument.

## Create custom instruments

The custom instruments allow you to create your own instruments configurations and save them in your Flat accounts. These instruments can be then be used when creating a new score or when changing instruments in your existing documents. Create and manage them [in your account settings](https://flat.io/settings/account/instruments).

### Pitched instruments

Custom **pitched instruments** allows you to create a complete configuration of your instruments:

#### 1. Base instrument

You can choose first an **base instrument** to build your custom instrument. Choose a base instrument to quickly re-use all the settings from an instrument and only change the settings you want. *For example*, if you only want to only have a custom name, always use a specific tuning on your TAB, or create an instrument with a different transposition mode

#### 2. Staves and Clefs

Choose the **staves and clefs** of your instrument.

![Custom staves and clefs](/help/assets/img/editor/custom-instru-pitched-staves-clefs.png)

#### 3. Transposition mode

Choose then the **transposition mode**: the note and octave. If your instrument is non-transposing (plays in concert pitch), choose **C** and **0**.

![Transposition mode](/help/assets/img/editor/custom-instru-pitched-transposition.png)

#### 4. Tablature configuration

You can then completely configure the **tablature** of the instrument. Choose first **how many strings** your plucked string instrument has (at this time we allow from 4 to 14 strings), its **complete tuning and capo**.

#### 5. Sound

Choose finally the **sound** of the instrument for our playback.

#### 6. Part name and abbreviation

Set the default part name and abbreviation that will be printed on your scores.

### Unpitched instruments *(Coming soon)*

Custom **unpitched instruments** will be available this quarter. They will include the ability to choose the staves settings, different percussion elements, their mapping and keyboard shortcuts to use them.
