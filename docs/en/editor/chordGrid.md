## Description

Chord grids/frames are a way of describing how to play a chord, by showing which strings are played, and 
which frets are pressed. 

## How to works with chord grids on Flat

To use the chord grids, you have to go in the instruments properties. There you can open the **Tablature, Chord Grids and Tuning**.
