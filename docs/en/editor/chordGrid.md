which frets are pressed.

## Tuning and Capo

Once your score is created, [the tuning and capo of a tab can be configured in the instrument settings](/help/en/music-notation-software/tuning.html). Changing the tuning or capo configuration will affect future chords added and updated. Using this feature, you can have grids from 3 to 14 strings with any tuning you want.
