One of the most common issue while setting up a MIDI device is when the device is not even recognized by the computer. Most of the time, it occurs because the software component for this device has not been installed.

This problem mostly happens with Windows and Linux, as MacOS and ChromeOS offer a generic driver which doesn't require the need for a driver.

On this page, we give the link to the major MIDI devices manufacturers drivers pages.
