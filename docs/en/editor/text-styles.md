Flat lets you customize the styles of the different text elements in your scores. To customize the text styles used in your score, **open the Layout Settings, next to the print button**.

On our desktop web app, this is usually located on the right of your screen, or in the "Document" toolbar. On our mobile app, click on the edit button on the top of your screen.

## Changing the default font family

In the *Layout settings*, scroll to *Text styles*. From there, you can set the default font family used for all the texts in your score.

## Adjusting specific texts styles

You can also change the **font family for specific text types** (e.g. only the title of the score), and also adjust the **weight** (i.e. bold) and **style** (i.e. italic) of the font.

For every specific text type, you can adjust the settings:

## Implementation notes: Default fonts

Before March 2018, the default font was [**Noto Serif**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif). This default font has been changed on March 2018, and the new one is now **URW Century Schoolbook L** (licensed under GNU GPL v2). The Noto Serif font remains available in the list of font families.

When using [the music font **Petaluma**](/help/en/music-notation-software/music-font-smufl.html), the default font will automatically be set to **Petaluma Script**.
