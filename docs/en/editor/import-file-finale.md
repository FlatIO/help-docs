To import your sheet music from any version of Finale on Flat, we advise you to use MusicXML. MusicXML is the standard exchange format for sheet music and includes all your notation details.

## Convert/Export your Finale file to MusicXML

Most Finale versions come with MusicXML export (including Finale NotePad 2012). In Finale, go to **File** → **MusicXML** → **Export**, or **File** → **Export** → **MusicXML**.

If your version of Finale can't export to MusicXML, or if you want a more accurate export, you can download and use [the Dolet plugin](https://www.musicxml.com/dolet-plugin/).

## Import your Finale MusicXML file on Flat

On Flat, go to [**My Library**](https://flat.io/my-library), then drag & drop your XML/MXL file. You can also click on the **Import a score or tab** button, or **New score or tab** and choose **Import your creation**:

Choose your file(s) to import, and they will be directly added to your Flat account.

We believe in cloud reversibility, so at any time you [can export your scores back in MusicXML from Flat](/help/en/music-notation-software/print-export.html) and open them with Finale.
