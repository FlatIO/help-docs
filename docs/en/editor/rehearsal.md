## What is a rehearsal mark?

A rehearsal letter is a boldface letter of the alphabet in an orchestral score, and its corresponding parts, that provides the conductor, who typically leads rehearsals, with a convenient spot to begin at places other than the start of movements or pieces.

## How to add or remove a rehearsal mark?

Put your cursor on the measure where you want to add your rehearsal mark. Go to the "**Measure**" toolbar, then click on the rehearsal icon and choose the type of rehearsal that you want to add:

* **Rehearsal Letter**: Flat automatically maintain a list of rehearsals for you, starting from **A**.
* **Rehearsal Number**: The number of the current measure is displayed as a rehearsal mark.
* **Custom rehearsal**: You can choose the text you want to add as a rehearsal mark.

To remove an existing rehearsal mark, click on the mark, then press the delete icon. You can also update it from this rehearsal mark popover.
