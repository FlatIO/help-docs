## What is a slide?

In guitar, the slide is a technic to make a note/chord change its pitch to another. It is usually done by wearing 
a tube on the fret finger. We can then move the tube along the fretboard in order to change the pitch of the note/chord
played. 

## How to add or remove a slide?

On the Tan toolbar, select the lefthand note/chord and click on the slide icon. Click again to remove the slide.
