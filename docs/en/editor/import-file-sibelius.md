To import your sheet music from any version of Sibelius on Flat, we advise you to use MusicXML. MusicXML is the standard exchange format for sheet music and includes all your notation details.

## Convert/Export your Sibelius file to MusicXML

If you are using **Sibelius 7 or above**, you can directly use the built-in MusicXML export. Go to **File** → **Export** → **MusicXML** and choose **Compressed (*.mxl)**.

If your version of **Sibelius is 6 or lower**, or want a better export, you can download and use [the Dolet plugin](https://www.musicxml.com/dolet-plugin/dolet-6-plugin-for-sibelius-5-1-and-later/).

## Import your Finale MusicXML file on Flat

On Flat, go to [**My Library**](https://flat.io/my-library), then drag & drop your XML/MXL file. You can also click on the **Import a score or tab** button, or **New score or tab** and choose **Import your creation**:

Choose your file(s) to import, and they will be directly added to your Flat account.

We believe in cloud reversibility, so at any time you [can export your scores back in MusicXML from Flat](/help/en/music-notation-software/print-export.html) and open them with Sibelius.
