To **add an accidental** (sharp, flat or natural), click on an existing note, then click on the accidental icon in the toolbar. 

You can cycle between adding an accidental, a **double sharp/flat**, removing it, or adding a **courtesy accidental** by clicking several times on the same accidental button.

If the cursor is on a rest, you can "prepare" the accidental for the note to be added.
