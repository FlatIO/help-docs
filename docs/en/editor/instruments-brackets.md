## Add and Edit Brackets

You can then add and edit your existing customer brackets on this page. **Click on the switches to enable/extend or disable a bracket**.
You also have a quick overview of the group of the left of the interface, and the preview of the score on the right part of the screen.

For example, you want to create two brackets: Flutes and Clarinets. Click on the switches between the parts to create the two brackets.
