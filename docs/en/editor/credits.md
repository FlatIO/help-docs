You can easily add and update credits information about your score: open our Web Editor and **click on the existing title of your score**. 

You can then add a **Title**, **Subtitle**, **Lyricist**, **Composer** and **License text** to your document. Additional *document settings* will be also displayed on the opened page (Instruments, Layout and Styles, Audio Playback and Audio Recordings).
