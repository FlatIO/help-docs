## Manually color your notes heads

You can **manually change the color of one or multiple notes** using the tool available in the Note toolbar. This tool allows to choose among a preset of colors and also use the color picker to use any color you want.

Put your cursor on a note to change a single note color, or select multiple notes to apply a color on a range of notes.
