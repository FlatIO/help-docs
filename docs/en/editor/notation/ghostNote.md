## What are ghost notes?

In music theory, a ghost note should be muted or soften when played. Usually, it has no distinctive pitch and is used to add a rhythmic value to the score. In music notation, the ghost note is represented by an “X” or in brackets for the note head. 

## Add a grace note on Flat
