In the normal mode of change duration, when you increase a duration, it will eat up rests/notes to make room. In the same way, if you reduce a duration, rests will be added to fill the space that was taken by the previous duration.

When you choose the insert mode for the duration change, increasing a duration will instead push the content to the right. Reducing the duration will pull back the content.
