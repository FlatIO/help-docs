Before adding students make sure [you created your class on Flat following this guide](/help/en/education/create-new-class.html).

In that guide we assume **that don't rely on any Classroom Management System**. If you use any of the listed below you can make your life much easier:

* [Google Classroom](/help/en/education/google-classroom/)
* [Microsoft Teams](help/en/education/microsoft-teams/)
* [Canvas](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/)
* [Schoology](/help/en/education/schoology/)

## Add students and teachers to an existing classroom

When opening a Flat for Education class, you can see multiple tabs available in the class navigation. Choose "**People**".

![Class People](/help/assets/img/edu/class-people-tab-empty.png)

Then click on "**Add People**". You will have multiple options available for you, we will detail them below.

## How to add students to a class

You will get three options prompted to manually add students to your class.

![Invite students](/help/assets/img/edu/class-add-people-manual.png)

### Share an invitation link or code

The first option will be to share a direct link with your students. If you can share a link with them, or display the invitation code on a projector/whiteboard, this will be the best option for you.

This is also the best option if your students have Google accounts (G Suite for Education) or Microsoft accounts (Office 365), and that you don't use Google Classroom or Microsoft Teams with them. They will be able to join your Flat class in 1-click with their Google/Microsoft account.

Once your students click on the link they will be able to create a new account or use their existing account to join your class.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In order to use that method your students must have a valid email address. If they don't, please read the next section.

### Manually create Flat for Education accounts

This method is useful when your students **don't have an email address** or you **don't want them to provide their email address**.

Click on **Add user** or choose **Import .CSV file** to create multiple accounts at once from a spreadsheet. Once you are done, click on **Create accounts** to create all the displayed accounts.

You will need to at least provide a **username** and a **password** for their Flat for Education account. The username can be unique in your school, for example you use your students firstnames.

### Add to your class existing people from your school

If you already created accounts for your students using the previous method or they used a SSO (Single-Sign On) like Google or Office 365 to create their accounts, you can browse all the created accounts to pick students that you want to add in your class. 

You can also use this option to add another teacher to your class. 

![search people to add to your class](/help/assets/img/edu/class-add-existing-search.png)

When you find those that you want to add to your class, you need to select them in the list:

![Select students](/help/assets/img/edu/class-add-people-select-list.png)

Click on "*Add 3 people*" and the students will be effectively added to your class. They are now part of your class!
