At some point, you may want to bring more music teachers from your school or district. Here is how to invite them to your school.

## 1. Open the People page

All the accounts from your Flat for Education can be managed in the "**People**" page.

## 2. Open the invitation page

On the top right of the page, click on "**Add People**".

Then choose "**Invite teachers and admins by email**".
If you previously synchronized a third-party app or LMS and you want to manually add another teacher, you will need to click first on "**I don't use an LMS**".

## 3. Invite admins and teachers

**An Admin** will be able to create classes, assignments, invite and remove staff members or students. Most importantly, Admins are the only ones that will be able to manage the billing settings of your school account.

**A teacher** will be able to create classes, assignments and invite students.

Now that you know the difference between the two roles you can invite another person with the right role:

Please make sure they can receive emails from outside of your school domains, otherwise you can copy the invitation link and send then directly.
