Flat gives you a really similar experience than creating an assignment on Google Classroom using a regular Google Docs/Slides. From **music composition to music theory and live collaborations**, Flat allows you to easily create any assignments that include music notation.

When creating an assignment on Flat, **this one will be automatically posted to your Google Classroom stream**. We also handle a two-way synchronization of the modifications and your students' submissions.

This assignment feature is also a great way to onboard your students on Flat: from their Google Classroom stream, they will have access to their activity on Flat in 1-click.

## Creating an assignment

There are two ways to create a Google Classroom assignment on Flat:

* From your class on Flat by clicking on "*Create an assignment*":

![Create an assignment from the Class on Flat](/help/assets/img/edu/gc-class-new-assignment.png?0)

* From any music score on Flat by clicking on "*Create an assignment*" next to the title. This will let you choose the [sharing mode of the score](#assignments-mode) of the score.

## Assignment mode

Just like a regular Google Docs, Flat gives you multiple different options when creating an assignment:

* **No attachment** or **Read-only shared score**: Your students will have a direct link to create a new document on Flat. The newly created scores will automatically be added to their submissions.
* **Shared writing** (= "Students can write"): Your students will all have a write access to your score. This is a great way to create a live collaboration with your whole class. If you want to organize smaller collaborations (e.g. 2 or 3 students), we advise you to ask one student from each group to create a new document/copy the original score, then add their peers by clicking on "*Collaborate*".
* **Template** (= "Make a copy for each student"): When your students will open the assignment from their Google Classroom stream, Flat will automatically copy the score and attach it to their submission.

## Assignment content and description

When you create or update an assignment, you will have the opportunity to complete the content of the assignment:

* At the first step, add **the name of the description** of the assignment. That's the main information that will be displayed in Google Classroom and Flat. You also have the possibility to link attachments or embed content: simply paste links into the description, we will automatically resolve them and attach them to your Google Classroom assignment.
* At the second step, adjust **the sharing settings of the attached score(s)**. Check out [the previous point](#assignment-mode) to learn more about the different modes available.
* At the last step, you can optionally add a **due date** and a **post date**. When specifying a post date, your assignment will be marked as "draft" in your Google Classroom course. This is also a great way to test the creation of an assignment without making it available to your students.

## Posting the assignment

Once you click on "*Post*", your assignment will be available in your Google Classroom stream. You will also have a direct link on Flat to open and preview the assignment on Classroom:

⚠️ Due to a limitation of Google Classroom, Flat cannot modify the attachments of the assignments once they are posted. Please carefully check that you selected the good score(s) and the [good assignment mode](#assignment-mode). If you made a mistake with the attachments, delete and re-create your assignment on Flat.
