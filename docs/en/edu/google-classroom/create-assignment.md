Flat gives you a similar experience than creating an assignment on Google Classroom using a regular Google Docs/Slides. From **music composition to music theory and live collaborations**, Flat allows you to easily create any assignments that include music notation.

When creating an assignment on Flat, **this one will be automatically posted to your Google Classroom stream**. We also handle a two-way synchronization of the modifications and your students' submissions.

This assignment feature is also a fantastic way to onboard your students on Flat: from their Google Classroom stream, they will have access to their activity on Flat in 1-click.

## Creating an assignment

To create a Google Classroom using Flat, open your class, then go to the "**Assignments** tab:

![Class tab: Assignments](/help/assets/img/edu/class-tab-assignments.png)

Click on the "**New Assignment**" button to get started and create your first assignment.

## Assignment mode

Just like a regular Google Docs, Flat gives you multiple different options when creating an assignment:

* **New score**: Your students will have a direct link to create a new document on Flat. The newly created scores will automatically be added to their submissions.
* **Template** (= "Make a copy for each student"): When your students will open the assignment from their Google Classroom stream, Flat will automatically copy the score and attach it to their submission.
* **Shared writing** (= "Students can write"): Your students will all have a write access to your score. This is a wonderful way to create a live collaboration with your whole class. If you want to organize smaller collaborations (e.g. 2 or 3 students), we recommend you to ask one student from each group to create a new document/copy the original score, then add their peers by clicking on "*Collaborate*".

## Assignment instructions

When you create or update an assignment, you will have the opportunity to complete the content of the assignment.

First, **the name and the instructions** of the assignment. That's the main information that will be displayed in Google Classroom and Flat.

You also have the possibility to link attachments or embed content: simply paste links into the description, we will automatically resolve them and attach them to your Google Classroom assignment.

Finally, you can optionally add a **due date** and a **publication date**. When specifying a post date, your assignment will be marked as "draft" in your Google Classroom course. This is also a great way to test the creation of an assignment without making it available to your students.
