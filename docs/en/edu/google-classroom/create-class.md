*You will need a Flat for Education account to use this feature, [check out the introduction](/help/en/education/google-classroom/).*

Adding a Google Classroom course on Flat will automatically provision or update your students' accounts into your private Flat for Education website, then enroll them in your Flat class. Once a course is synchronized on Flat, future roster updates will be instant and automatic, you don't have anything to do!

In a couple of clicks, you will have your first group ready, and be able to create your first music notation on Google Classroom using Flat. Discover below how to set up a new Google Classroom course on Flat.
