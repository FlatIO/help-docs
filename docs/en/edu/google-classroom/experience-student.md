Once [you created your first music notation assignment](/help/en/education/google-classroom/create-music-notation-assignment.html), how do your students will experience Flat? You will now discover the seamless experience between Flat and Google Classroom.

First of all, note that until you post a link to Flat or an assignment, your students won't be aware that they have an account ready on Flat. So simply starting by synchronizing the rostering won't show anything in your Google Classroom course. We also never send any onboarding or marketing email to the students.

## Onboard your students

You have different ways to onboard your students on Flat with their Google Accounts, here are a few of them:

* **If you posted an assignment to their course**, they will have a direct link to the activity on Flat. At their sign in, they will directly arrive on the score you shared with them (e.g. copy of a template), or be invited to create a new score for the assignment.
* **If you synchronized a course on Flat**, their account will be provisioned and they will see the course at their connection to Flat (from our homepage or any app / link).
* **You can also directly give them the link of your Flat for Education website** (e.g. **https://[my-school].flat.io**). They will see a "Google Sign in" button on that page that will allow them to sign in.

## Assignments in their Google Classroom stream

If you [posted an assignment with no attachment](/help/en/education/google-classroom/create-music-notation-assignment.html#assignment-mode), they will see a direct link to create a new score. This link will also attach the newly created score to the student's submission:

If you posted an assignment with an attachment ([**shared writing** or a **template that makes copies**](/help/en/education/google-classroom/create-music-notation-assignment.html#assignment-mode)), your students will have a direct link to the shared resource or copy of the original resource.

Once they open the copy of the score or create a new score for the assignment, their work will automatically be attached to their submission on Flat and Google Classroom. You also have access to their work anytime from Flat, this allows you to give live feedback on their work before they submit it

## Turn in

Once your students complete the assignment, they will have a "*Turn in*" button at the top of the editor. They can then confirm that the assignment is done, and Flat will bring them back directly in their Google Classroom Classwork page.
