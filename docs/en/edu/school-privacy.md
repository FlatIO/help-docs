There are three privacy settings that you could set according to the needs of your organization.

## Public scores on the Internet
Allow your users to share their scores publicly on our website flat.io. These scores might be indexed by search engines like Google, and other users from our public community will be able to send comments on the scores. Your users' profile information will be anonymized. **This feature is disabled by default**.

## Collaboration with external users
Allow your users to invite external Flat users to collaborate on their music scores. Your users' profile information will be anonymized. **This feature is disabled by default**.

## Automatically accept scores invitations

Shared scores will be available in the users accounts without having to manually approve each invitation. **This feature is enabled by default**, we know many students manually share scores with their teachers and their classmates and this will save you some time.

If you choose to **disable this feature**, you will receive notifications like that where you can manually accept an invitation to join a shared score:

## Comments restriction
Allow you to set comment restriction to all Flat users in your organization.

* **Everybody can comment**: This is the default setting. There are no restrictions, everybody can create a new comment thread or reply to an existing comment. 

* **Students can reply to teachers**: With this mode, only teachers can start a new comment thread. Students can only reply to the comments initiated by the teachers.

* **Nobody can comment**: With this mode, nobody in your organization can start a comment thread or reply to an existing comment.
