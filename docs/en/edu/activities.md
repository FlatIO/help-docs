They are different kinds of activities and assignments you can create in Flat for Education. In order to create your first one, you have to make sure that you already [created your first class](/help/en/education/create-new-class.html).

You can open a list of all your existing assignments by clicking on the left icon.
You can start creating a new assignment by pressing the other button on the right.

## 1. Pick your assignment type

There are 4 different kinds of assignment or activities that you can create:

### New score

Your students will have to create a new score, work on it following your guidelines and submit it back to you.

### Read

This mode is meant to share a score that is part of your own library without the students being able to edit / alter it.

### Write

If you want to create a group activity with all the students working on the same piece in real-time.

⚠️ We advise keeping the number of students on the same group activity below 15.

💡 We are currently working on a group picker to quickly create smaller workgroup within the same class :)

### Template

All the students will get a copy of one of your score to start from. You can imagine many different activities around that:

* find the mistake
* complete the interval
* finish the composition
* ...

💡 We are currently working on a whole new range of exercises to avoid you manually creating basic exercises.

## 2. Setup the assignment
