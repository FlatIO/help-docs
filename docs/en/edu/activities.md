They are various kinds of activities and assignments you can create in Flat for Education. To create your first one, you must make sure that you already [created your first class](/help/en/education/create-new-class.html).

You can open all your existing assignments and create new ones by opening the "**Assignments**" tab in your class.

## Creating a new assignment

Click on the "**New Assignment**" button to get started and create your first assignment.

![Stream view](/help/assets/img/edu/class-new-assignment-pick-type.png)

#### New score

Your students will have to create a new score, work on it following your instructions, and send it back to you.

#### Template

Each of your students will get a copy of one of your scores to start from. You can imagine many different activities around that:

* Find the mistakes
* Complete the intervals/chords
* Write a missing part
* Finish the composition
* ... The possibilities are endless.

Once your students are done, they can send their work in 1-click from the editor.

You can get more information regarding the template assignment on [this page](/help/en/education/templates.html). 

#### Shared writing

If you want to create a group activity with all the students working on the same piece in real-time.

While we don't have a limit on the number of participants, we recommend keeping the number of students on the same group activity below 15.

### Choose the score(s)

If you choose "**Template**" or "**Shared writing**", you will need to select one or multiple scores that will be used for your assignment.

Click on "**Select score**" and choose a score you have in your Flat for Education account, either [created using our editor](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html) or [imported in your account](/help/en/music-notation-software/import.html).

Once a score is chosen, this one will be displayed like that:

### 3. Add instructions

You can then add instructions to your new assignment. They can either be some text you directly add to your assignment, or as an attached file or link. You can attach all the resources you need: documents, presentations, videos, audio files, read-only scores, etc.
