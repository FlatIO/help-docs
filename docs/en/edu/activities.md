They are various kinds of activities and assignments you can create in Flat for Education. To create your first one, you must make sure that you already [created your first class](/help/en/education/create-new-class.html).

![Class tab: Assignments](/help/assets/img/edu/class-tab-assignments.png)

You can open all your existing assignments and create new ones by opening the "**Assignments**" tab in your class.

## Creating a new assignment

Click on the "**+ Create**" button to access a variety of activities. This help page focuses on classic assignments, but feel free to visit the dedicated pages for [Worksheets](/help/en/education/worksheet.html) and [Performance assignments](/help/en/education/performance-assignments.html)

### 1. Name your assignment

### 2. Pick your assignment type

There are 3 kinds of assignment or activities that you can create:

![Stream view](/help/assets/img/edu/class-new-assignment-pick-type.png)

#### New score

Your students will have to create a new score, work on it following your instructions, and send it back to you.

#### Template

Each of your students will get a copy of one of your scores to start from. You can imagine many different activities around that:

* Find the mistakes
* Complete the intervals/chords
* Write a missing part
* Finish the composition
* [Melodic and Rhythmic dictation](/help/en/education/dictation.html)
* ... The possibilities are endless.

Once your students are done, they can send their work in 1-click from the editor.

You can get more information regarding the template assignment on [this page](/help/en/education/templates.html).

#### Shared writing

If you want to create a group activity with all the students working on the same piece in real-time.

While we don't have a limit on the number of participants, we recommend keeping the number of students on the same group activity below 15.

### Choose the score(s)

If you choose "**[Template](/help/en/education/templates.html)**" or "**Shared writing**", you will need to select one or multiple scores that will be used for your assignment.

Click on "**Select score**" and choose a score you have in your Flat for Education account, either [created using our editor](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html) or [imported in your account](/help/en/music-notation-software/import.html).

Once a score is chosen, this one will be displayed like that:

### 3. Add instructions

You can then add instructions to your new assignment. They can either be some text you directly add to your assignment, or as an attached file or link. You can attach all the resources you need: documents, presentations, videos, audio files, read-only scores, etc.

### 4. Extra options

Finally, you can add some extra options to your assignment:

* **Due Date**: You can choose when your students need to submit their work. (Note: Students will be still able to send their work after the due date, but they will be marked as turned in late.)
* **Publication Date**: You can create your assignment in advance and set a publication date when the assignment will become available to the classroom.
* **Grading**: You can set the maximum number of points for the assignment. If you connected Google Classroom or an LMS, the grades added to Flat for Education will automatically be added to your LMS gradebook.
* **[Assigned students](/help/en/education/assign-individual-students.html)**: By default, the assignment is assigned to all the students from your class, you can choose here to assign individual students. [Learn more](/help/en/education/assign-individual-students.html).

* **[Lock Template](/help/en/education/templates.html#locking-template)**: If you are using a score as a template in your assignment, you can prevent your students from changing the original notes. [Learn more](/help/en/education/templates.html#locking-template).
* **[Playback limit](/help/en/education/dictation.html#3-create-the-assignment)**: If you want to limit the number of times your students will play the score. You can use this option for [your dictation and ear training activities](/help/en/education/dictation.html).
