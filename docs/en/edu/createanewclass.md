## 3. Invite your students to your new class
Last step, invite your students in your new class. 2 ways to do it:
  * **Share the class link or code**
With the link, your students go to the website and are registered as students of your class.
With the code, your students sign up or sign in on your personal flat.io web address, then enter this code to join your class.

  * **Manually add students**
You can search an existing student in your organization and add him to your class, or create new accounts for your students.

In this last case, a new window opens. You can create manually new accounts for your students. **Enter his username, his email address (optional) and his password**.
If you want, you can set a common password for these new accounts. For that, click on the tik box below "Create new accounts for your students".
If you have a lot of accounts to create, you can import a spreadsheet in the format .CSV.

**Import**: Format your CSV file with 2 or 3 column like the above input: the username in the first column, the password in the second one, and optionally the email in the third one. If you want to use a common password, you can upload a CSV with only a single column (the username).

## 4. That's all!
You are now all set to create your first assignment, share a music score and enjoy Flat with your student!
