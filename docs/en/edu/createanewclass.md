#### What is the purpose of a class?

Creating a class will make it much more easier to organise and share activities of any kind with your students.
We have a [dedicated section]() about the different kind of activities you can create and assign to your classroom.
Most of the time, we advise to follow the same organisation as you have in your "real" classroom.

## 2. Name your new class
You now have a new page opened where you can create and manage your class. 2 ways to do it:
  * **Create your class on Flat**
  * **Use Google Classroom**

## 3. Invite your students to your new class

Once you validate your class name you will be able to invite / add students in it.
