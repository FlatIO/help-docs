As soon [you post your first assignment](/help/en/education/assignments-activities.html) and [add students to your Flat for Education class](/help/en/education/invite-students.html), they can start working with Flat.

During your assignments you can follow the progress of your students from the assignments' dashboard. You will have an overview of their work across  the different assignments:
