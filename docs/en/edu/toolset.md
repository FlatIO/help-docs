For some assignments, you might want to reduce the number of tools available to your students in the music notation editor.
It can be for the sake of clarity, by removing advanced notations for young students, or it can be because of the nature of the assignment, that only require specific tools to be completed. 

When you create or edit an assignment, you can select or create a custom toolset in the options section ("Extras").

Click on the pen icon to access the list of available toolsets. From here you can select the set of tools you want for the assignment, or even create new toolset.

When you create a toolset, you can choose to enable or disable tools from several families. 
Each family contains multiple groups, that can sometimes be divided into actions.

When the students work on an assignment with a specific toolset, only the tools that are part of the toolset will be available. For instance, if the clef edition is not enabled, the option will not be available in the toolbar, and they will not be able to click on existing clefs in the score to change those. 
Some controls can also be hidden: if you disable the audio, the play and equalizer controls will be hidden. 

You can use a minimal toolset for young students to compose songs. In the example below, they can only add notes, change durations, add lyrics, and add/remove measures.

If you only enable the tool to change note heads colors, you can create assignments where students need to identify elements in the score, like perfect fifths on a 4 voices composition. 

You can only enable the roman numerals and ask your student to identify chords.

If you just enable the articulations and dynamics, you can create an assignment where the student has to add the expression to an existing piece of music.
