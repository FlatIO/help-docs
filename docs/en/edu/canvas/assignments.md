*You will need a Flat for Education account to use this feature, [check out the introduction](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/).*

[Once your Canvas course is configured to use our app](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/setup-configuration.html), you can use Flat for Education to make assignments in Canvas.

## New Canvas assignment

Start by opening the "**Assignment**" page in your Canvas course, then click on "**+ Assignment**". You can complete the assignment details like any other Canvas assignments.

To use Flat for Education for your assignment, in **Submission Type** choose **External Tool**, then click on **Find** and Choose **Flat** in the list, and **Select** the tool.

You can then click on **Save** at the bottom of the Canvas page. This will give you the ability to select the options for your Flat for Education assignment.

Select the assignment type (New score, Template, Sharing Writing) and the different options, then click on **Create** at the bottom of the page to make the assignment available for your students. You can also [check out dedicated guide for more details on the available options](/help/en/education/assignments-activities.html#creating-a-new-assignment).

That's all, your assignment is ready! You might want to [experience it as a student](#experience-as-a-student) in Canvas to see how your students will use Flat in Canvas.

## Experience as a student

In Canvas, you have the possibility of view your courses as a student and try how the assignments you configured will be displayed for them. In the **Course Settings**, choose **Student View** on the right, you will see a pink border when you are using this mode:

For example, if you open an assignment where the submission type [is Flat as an *External Tool*](##flat-as-an-external-tool) and you used a Template, you will directly get a copy of the original score displayed that you can change right in Canvas. Once you are done the work (as a student), simply click on "**Turn in**" to submit the assignment. This one [will show up in the SpeedGrader, ready to be reviewed](#review-submissions-with-speedgrader).

## Review submissions with SpeedGrader

Once your students worked on Flat from Canvas, you can directly open their work from SpeedGrader. SpeedGrader will allow you to review and grade right from Canvas while viewing their work made using Flat:
