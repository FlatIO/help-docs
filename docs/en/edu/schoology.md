As **Tool provider**, choose "Flat", then add at least a title for your new assignment. Don't add any URL, Consumer Key or Shared secret here (don't click on any "Custom" links, otherwise Schoology will not let you submit the form). You can use options like Grading and individual assignments if you want. Press "**Submit"** to create your assignment in Schoology.

## Embed interactive sheet music in Schoology

Click on **Add Materials** and **Flat**:

![Add music notation materials in Schoology](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-1.png)

Choose the score you want to share in your class. You can choose "**Link**" to insert a simple link, or "**Embed**" to insert a rich player in your Materials page.

![Choose the resource](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-2.png)

Here is how the embedded material will look on your Schoology materials page. If you don't have a small score, you might want to use a link or embed it in a Schoology page (cf below) since Schoology doesn't allow us to insert bigger embeds on the Materials page.

![Embed resource](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-3.png)

### Embed on a Schoology page

You can also embed a score in a dedicated Schoology Page with some other content. First, create a new Page in **Add Materials > Add Page** and choose a title for this one. When you want to insert a score in your page, click on **Insert content > Flat** and choose "**Embed**" next to a score.

![Choose the resource](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-page-insert.png)
