## Embed interactive sheet music in Schoology

### Embed on your Materials page

You can easily embed read-only and interactive sheet music in your Schoology in your Materials page:

Click on **Add Materials** and **Flat**:

![Add music notation materials in Schoology](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-1.png)

Choose the score you want to share in your class. You can choose "**Link**" to insert a simple link, or "**Embed**" to insert a rich player in your Materials page.

![Choose the resource](/help/assets/img/edu/schoology-embed-2.png)

Here is how the embedded material will look on your Schoology materials page. If you don't have a small score, you might want to use a link or embed it in a Schoology page (cf below) since Schoology doesn't allow us to insert bigger embeds on the Materials page.

### Embed on a Schoology page

You can also embed a score in a dedicated Schoology Page with some other content. First, create a new Page in **Add Materials > Add Page** and choose a title for this one. When you want to insert a score in your page, click on **Insert content > Flat** and choose "**Embed**" next to a score.
