Flat is a cloud-based music notation app, available both on the web and mobile. With our Microsoft Teams app, **you can quickly share any music score from your Flat account to a Teams Group or Chat as an interactive tab**. Other Teams user can access it in 1-click, and no need for them to sign in to Flat.

Once your interactive score is added as a tab to your group or chat, any participants can view it, play it using our playback or an external audio/video, and directly print it from Microsoft Teams.
