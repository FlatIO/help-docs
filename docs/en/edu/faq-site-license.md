## How does a site license work?

A [Flat for Education site license](https://flat.io/edu/pricing) is a license for your school or district that includes a certain number of seats with unlimited access to Flat for Education. You can purchase a site license by year or quarter. Our site licenses include a minimum of 50 seats that can be used by the people of your school account (teachers or students).

The advantages of our site license:

* All the seats **start and end at the same date**, so you don't have to worry about specific accounts dates.
* You can **re-use seats during the year**. When a student leaves your class, you can delete their account to make available the seat for another student.
* Seats are **automatically assigned to active people**. This means only the people from your school account who sign in will get a seat from your site license. When you move from a free trial to a purchased site license, people get automatically get a seat from your new site license.
* They are **cheaper** than our individual product (97% cheaper), you can [discover our pricing here](https://flat.io/edu/pricing).

## How seats from a site license work?

Once you purchased a site license, you can have an overview of the usage of this one in your settings: [School Settings > Billing](https://flat.io/settings/school/billing). This page gives you a breakdown of the seats from your site license as well as information about the expiration date and direct links to the people list using this site license.

The breakdown can include the following lines:

* **Active seats**: The seats that are assigned and used by people from your school account. Seats are automatically assigned when people sign in to Flat for Education.
* **Unused seats**: Remaining seats that are not used yet. When someone starts using their Flat for Education account, we automatically take an unused seat and assign it to their account.
* **Surplus accounts with no seats**: Once all your seats are used, you will see here how many accounts won't have a seat and won't be able to use Flat for Education. In this case, you can either purchase additional seats or remove old and inactive accounts who are using a seat. If you have too many accounts, this will also be displayed in red next to the total seats number:

To re-use a seat and remove an account, you can either open the list of people using a seat from that page, or from the "People" navigation item. [Check out our dedicated guide to learn how to remove Flat for Education accounts](/help/en/education/remove-students-organization.html).
