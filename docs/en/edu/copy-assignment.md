Once [you created your assignment on Flat for Education](/help/en/education/assignments-activities.html), you might want to copy it if you have multiple classes. To reuse this assignment, open your assignments list or assignment, then click on "Reuse".

When viewing the assignments list, this option is available when you click on the "..." button. On the assignment page, you will see a "Re-use" button available on the right of the screen.
