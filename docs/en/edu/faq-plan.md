## How does the Flat for Education plan work?

A [Flat for Education plan](https://flat.io/edu/pricing) is a license for your school or district that includes a certain number of seats with unlimited access to Flat for Education. You can purchase a plan by year or quarter. Our plan includes a minimum of 50 seats that can be used by the people of your school account (teachers or students).

The advantages of our education plan:

* All the seats **start and end at the same date**, so you don't have to worry about specific accounts dates.
* You can **re-use seats during the year**. When a student leaves your class, you can delete their account to make available the seat for another student.
* Seats are **automatically assigned to active people**. This means only the people from your school account who sign in will get a seat from your plan. When you move from a free trial to a purchased paying plan, people get automatically get a seat from your plan.
* They are **cheaper** than our individual product (96% cheaper), you can [discover our pricing here](https://flat.io/edu/pricing).

## How seats from a Flat for Education plan work?

Once you purchased a plan, you can have an overview of the usage of this one in your settings: [School Settings > Billing](https://flat.io/settings/school/billing). This page gives you a breakdown of the seats from your plan as well as information about the expiration date and direct links to the people list using this plan.

![Plan overview](/help/assets/img/edu/your-plan-active-unused.png)

The breakdown can include the following lines:

* **Active seats**: The seats that are assigned and used by people from your school account. Seats are automatically assigned when people sign in to Flat for Education.
* **Unused seats**: Remaining seats that are not used yet. When someone starts using their Flat for Education account, we automatically take an unused seat and assign it to their account.
* **Surplus accounts with no seats**: Once all your seats are used, you will see here how many accounts won't have a seat and won't be able to use Flat for Education. In this case, you can either purchase additional seats or remove old and inactive accounts who are using a seat. If you have too many accounts, this will also be displayed in red next to the total seats number:

To re-use a seat and remove an account, you can either open the list of people using a seat from that page, or from the "People" navigation item. [Check out our dedicated guide to learn how to remove Flat for Education accounts](/help/en/education/remove-students-organization.html).
