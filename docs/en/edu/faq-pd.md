Yes, we can provide some Professional Development for you and your school, please [contact our team (edu@flat.io)](mailto:edu@flat.io) to schedule it with us and choose the points that you want to work with us.

We usually provide PD as a Google Meet/Skype session with one member of our product team, and we present you how to get started with Flat for Education: how you can set up our product to use it with your students, how you can integrate it with your existing tools and apps, how to use to create music assignments and activities, and more!
