When comes the end of the semester or the year you might want to remove old students accounts to free licenses.

**A removed account cannot be restored, please be careful and make sure your students already saved all their work locally.**

## 1. Open the People page

All the accounts from your Flat for Education can be managed in the "**People**" page.

* Convert the selected accounts into individual ones. You can do that only if your students are older than the legal age in your country. If you have any doubts please check our [dedicated page](/help/en/policies/required-age.html).
* Remove them and all relative data from our platform.

Once you click on the confirmation button everything will be processed on our side and you can keep on working.
