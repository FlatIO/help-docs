The EU’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) take effect May 25, 2018. It will set a new standard for how companies use and protect EU citizens’ data. For the past few months the entire team has been committed to understand and ensure that we fulfill its obligations, maintain and improve our transparency about customer messaging and how we use data.

## What is the GDPR?

In a few words, The [EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en). is a new comprehensive data protection law that comes into effect on May 25, 2018. It will replace existing EU Data Protection law to strengthen the protection of “personal data” and the rights of the individual. It will be a single set of rules which govern the processing and monitoring of EU data.

## What actions did we take to comply with the GDPR?

Since the beginning of 2018, we (the entire team) have been actively working to:
* Understand the GDPR and what it involves for the company and our internal processes.
* Train ourselves to always put the data security at first; either when developing new features either we consider using a new tool to help us operate the company.
* We picked and designated a Data Protection Officer that will ensure that personal data security is always ensured!
* We reviewed our entire infrastructure to ensure that we respect every state of the art security practice.
* We reviewed all our vendors, find out about their GDPR plans to arrange GDPR compliant data processing agreement.
* We have updated our Privacy Policy and provided a Data processing addendum for schools to reflect our data security commitment.
* In order to reinforce our transparency about customer data usage we listed and created a clear explanation for every single one.

### Understand the GDPR

We spent the first quarter of 2018 working with our lawyers to understand the GDPR, what it implies for us in terms of infrastructure, organizational impact and product changes.
We understood that many requirements were really close to the COPPA / FERPA American acts that we've been committed to follow since early 2015.

### Training and internal audit

We created a new internal team activity that intends to train all the staff with state of the art practice to:
* Watch the community and customers data
* Put always our security duty at first when it comes to manipulating these data
* Always think security first when it comes to new developments
* Learn how to properly handle a security breach (countermeasures and internal communication)
* Take appropriate measures following the security breach awareness (internal and external communication)

Once per quarter the DPO will do this activity with the entire team to be sure everyone is up to date and still applies these golden rules on each working days.

The DPO will also personally onboard every new employee to give them enough knowledge and awareness before granting access to any customer data.

Finally, the DPO will run once month small unexpected internal audits to assess that team member follow and respect guidelines.

### Data Protection Officer (DPO)

We took some time to clearly understood all the duties and responsibilities of this important role. Since we are still a small company we decided to appoint someone from our existing staff. Pierre Rannou current CEO & sole director of the company has been appointed on the 5th of January 2018. You can contact him at [dpo@flat.io](mailto:dpo@flat.io).

### Personal Data, Infrastructure and International transfers of personal data

We reviewed our complete infrastructure and made some changes on how we transfer personal data outside the EEA. For instance, we removed the data we were replicating Singapore. We now only store and transfer personal data in the EEA, in Canada, and in the US to Companies that adopted the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. These technical choices follow the [adequacy requirements of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en) provided by the EU.

We now keep records of the what data we store and process: *What Data*, *When*, *Where*, and adjusted the different retention periods to reflect our updated privacy policy. We anonymized and removed data (e.g. IPs of guest visitors) that was not required to run our service.

### Review of our vendors (subprocessors)

We have a strong culture of processing data on homemade tools, that's why we keep the number of vendors very low. During our GDPR preparation, we reviewed them all assess that they are GDPR compliant or make sure that they are committed to be compliant before May 25, 2018.

You can find all the vendors (subprocessors) we work with on [this page](/help/en/general/data-infrastructure.html#subprocessors) and how we use them.

### We add new features on Flat

We took the advantage of the GDPR to make some enhancements to the platform, here are a couple of the visible updates:

* When you create an individual account on our public platform, we now require you [to verify your age](/help/en/policies/required-age.html). Check out our [dedicated FAQ](/help/en/policies/required-age.html) to learn more about this change.
* We separately ask consent for our Terms of Service and marketing communication, and properly store consents.

### DPA for schools

We now provide a dedicated [data processing addendum (DPA)](...) for schools using [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu).

### Privacy Policy

We updated our [privacy policy](/help/en/policies/privacy-policy.html) to reflect these changes and our compliance with GDPR. This one now includes a clear annex on the personal information we collect and how we use it in our service.
