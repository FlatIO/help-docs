## Your Right to Cancel

If you are in the EU, you have a right to cancel your subscription without giving any reason for up to 14 days from the day after you entered your subscription agreement with us. This is known as the "**Cancellation Period**".

## Refund of Your Subscription Fee
If you cancel your subscription during the Cancellation Period, we will refund your subscription fee.

Your refund will take place no later than the end of 14 days after the day on which you informed us of your decision to cancel your subscription.

We will make any refund to you using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction unless you have expressly agreed with us otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement (except for the services you have received before cancelling).

## How to Exercise You Right To Cancel
To exercise your right to cancel, you must inform us of your decision to cancel your subscription with us by making a clear statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or email). The easiest way to do this is to contact our Customer Support team by using this link: https://flat.io/support. You may also want to use the model cancellation form below but you are not required to do so.
