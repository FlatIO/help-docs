Thanks so much for your interest in Flat and your willingness to use our service. As an internet website open to everyone, we need to comply with local regulations. You will find below common questions and answers regarding required age.

If you want to read through all of our policies and terms, they are available right [here](/help/en/policies).

## Why do you need to check my age for your website? What do I need to do if I am below the required age?

Countries' regulations require us to check that you are 13 years of age or older and eligible based on your country of residence.

If you are under age and want to use an individual Flat account, you will need the consent of your parent or legal guardian. They can [contact us](https://flat.io/support) regarding that matter. A simple solution here can also be to ask them to create a Flat account for you.

**Note**: These requirements may not be applicable for [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) accounts, which are subject to [different Terms of Service](/help/en/policies/#for-schools-and-businesses-using-flat-for-education).

## Who can see your age?

Your age isn't visible to others on the platforms. We use it solely to comply with laws in your country of residence.
