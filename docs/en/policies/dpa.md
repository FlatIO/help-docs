## 2.	Data processing

**2.1**	Instructions for Data Processing. Flat will only Process Customer Personal Data in accordance with 

* **(a)** the Agreement, to the extent necessary to provide the Service to you, and 
* **(b)** the your written instructions, unless Processing is required by European Union or Member State law to which Flat is subject, in which case Flat shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, inform you of that legal requirement before Processing Customer Personal Data in that way. 

**2.2**	The Agreement (subject to any changes to the Service agreed between the Parties) and this DPA shall be your complete and final instructions to Flat in relation to the processing of Customer Personal Data. Processing outside the scope of this DPA or the Agreement will require prior written agreement between you and Flat on additional instructions for Processing.

**2.3**	Where applicable by virtue of Article 28(3)(h) of the GDPR, Flat shall immediately notify you in the event that Flat believes your instructions conflict with the requirements of the GDPR or other EU or Member State laws.

* **(a)**	the Processing of any Customer Personal Data will be consistent with the information communicated to the relevant Data Subjects or as otherwise necessary in accordance with applicable law; and

## 3.	Transfer of personal data

**3.1	Authorised Subprocessors.** You agree that Flat may use [the entities listed here (https://flat.io/help/en/general/data-infrastructure.html#subprocessors)](/help/en/general/data-infrastructure.html#subprocessors) as Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data.

**3.2**	You agree that Flat may use subcontractors to fulfil its contractual obligations under the Agreement and Flat shall notify you from time to time of the identity of any amendments to the Subprocessors it engages. If you (acting reasonably) do not approve of a new Subprocessor, then without prejudice to any right to terminate the Agreement, you may request that Flat moves Customer Personal Data to another Subprocessor and Flat shall, within a reasonable time following receipt of such request, use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that the Subprocessor does not Process any of the Customer Personal Data. 

**3.3**	Save as set out in paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2, Flat shall not permit, allow or otherwise facilitate Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data without your prior written consent and unless Flat enters into a written agreement with the Subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the Subprocessor with regard to their Processing of Customer Personal Data, as are imposed on Flat under this DPA. 

**3.4	Liability of Subprocessors.** Flat shall at all times remain responsible for compliance with its obligations under the DPA and will be liable to you for the acts and omissions of any Subprocessor approved by you in accordance with paragraphs **3.1** and **3.2** as if they were the acts and omissions of Flat.

**3.5	Prohibition on Transfers of Personal Data.** To the extent that the Processing of Customer Personal Data by Flat involves the export of such Personal Data to a country or territory outside the EEA, Flat shall ensure that:

* **(a)**	the recipient, or the country or territory in which it Processes or accesses the Personal Data, ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the Processing of Customer Personal Data as determined by the European Commission; or
* **(b)**	the transfer is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses or (where relevant) the U.S. â€“ EU Privacy Shield, or another legally recognised transfer method. If there is any inconsistency between any of the provisions of the Standard Contractual Clauses and the provisions of the Agreement, the provisions of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

## 4.	Data security, audits and security notifications

**4.2	Security Audit.** You may, upon reasonable notice, audit (either by itself or using independent third party auditors) Flat's compliance with the security measures set out in this DPA (including the technical and organisational measures as set out in [here](/policies/data-processing-addendum-security.html)), including by conducting audits of Flat's data processing facilities. Flat shall assist with, and contribute to any audits conducted in accordance with this paragraph 4.2.
