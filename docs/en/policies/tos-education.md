If the terms of service that your school or other educational organisation that you are linked to has agreed with us terminate for any reason, for example, because your school or other educational organisation that you are linked to chooses not to purchase a licence for you any longer or because you stop attending the school or other educational organisation that you are linked to, your right to use the Service will end. If this happens, you may be able to sign up to Flat Individual service and keep your User Content. You will be asked to sign up to the Flat Individual terms of service, which are available at flat.io/legal/tos-individual. We will send you an email with instructions on how to do this.

**11.3.** We may also withdraw the Service as long as we give you reasonable notice that we plan to do this so that you have a reasonable period of time to download any of your User Content.

**11.4.** If at any time you do not feel that you can agree to these Terms of Service or any changes made to the Terms of Service or the Service, you must immediately stop using the Service.

**11.5.** If you wish to end your use of the Service, please contact us at [support@flat.io](mailto:support@flat.io) and request that we deactivate your account and delete your data and any User Content you have created.

**11.6.** If you or we end your use of the Service or we withdraw the Service as described in this section, we may delete or modify your User Content, account or any other information we hold about you. You will also lose any rights you have to use the Service or access our content or your User Content. We will not offer you compensation for any losses.

## 12. Disclaimer: User Content

**12.1.** Our Service makes available User Content and we do not produce User Content and
cannot be responsible for it in anyway.

**12.2.** Where you follow a link to other sites or resources and make a purchase from that site or resource the purchase is solely between you and the seller. Complaints, questions and claims related to the sale item should be directed to the seller.

**12.3.** We are not the seller of any item you purchase from third parties, we have no control and do not give any commitment relating to the existence, quality, genuineness of the item, the truth or accuracy of the picture or description of the item or any other content made available by the third party.

## 13. Our liability/responsibility to you

**13.1.** We have committed with your School that we will use commercially reasonable endeavours
to make the Service available with an uptime rate of 99%, except for:
* **(a)** Planned maintenance for which 24 hours' notice will be given; or
* **(b)** Unscheduled maintenance during normal business hours (UK time) or otherwise, for which Flat will use reasonable endeavours to give you advance notice.

**13.2.** To the extent permitted by the law, we do not accept any responsibility whatsoever for any claims arising out of the provision of the Service.

**14.2.** In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a dispute informally, we will discuss and agree with you the most effective way of resolving our dispute.

## 15. Changes to the Service

**15.1.** We are constantly updating and improving the Service to try and find ways to provide you with new and innovative features and services. Improvements and updates are also made to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the way people use the Internet and our Service.

**15.2.** In order to do this, we may need to update, reset, stop offering and/or supporting a particular part of the Service, or feature relating to the Service ("changes to the Service"). These changes to the Service may affect your past activities on the Service, features that you use and your User Content ("Service elements"). Any changes to the Service could involve your Service elements being deleted or reset.

**15.3.** You agree that a key characteristic of our Service is that changes to the Service will take place over time and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to the Service. Once we have made changes to the Service, your continued use of the Service will show that you have accepted any changes to the Service. You are always free to stop using the Service.

**15.4.** We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to the Service.

##16. Changes to the documents

**16.1.** We may revise these Terms of Service from time to time but the most current version will
always be at [flat.io/legal/tos-edu](https://flat.io/legal/tos-edu).

**16.2.** Changes will usually occur because of new features being added to the Service, changes
in the law or where we need to clarify our position on something.

**16.3.** We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to any of the documents referred to in these Terms of Service. We may contact you through the Service (for example by asking you to accept the changes before you continue to use the Service) or via a separate email.

**16.4.** Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become effective. However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give you any notice.

## 17. Documents that apply to our relationship with you

**17.1.** The current version of the Terms of Service contains the only terms and conditions that apply to our relationship with you. Older versions of the Terms of Service will no longer apply to our relationship and will be completely replaced by the current version.

**17.2.** We intend to rely on these Terms of Service as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you for the provision of the Service. If part of the Terms of Service cannot be enforced then the remainder of the Terms of Service will still apply to our relationship.

**17.3.** If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we have and we may still take action in the future.

## 18. Law

**18.1.** As we are based in England, English law will apply to all disputes and the interpretation of these Terms of Service. The English courts will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising from or related to your use of the Service.

## 19. Contact, feedback and complaints

**19.1.** If you need to contact us in relation to these Terms of Service or any other document
mentioned in them, please email us at [support@flat.io](mailto:support@flat.io).

**19.2.** We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in learning about ways we can improve the Service.
