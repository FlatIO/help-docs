Flat includes two different music fonts that can be used to display your sheet music: Classical and Jazz/Handwritten. 

To customize the music font used in your score, **open the Layout Settings, next to the print button**.

On our desktop web app, this is usually located on the right of your screen, or in the "Document" toolbar. On our mobile app, click on the edit button on the top of your screen.

## Implementation notes

[In 2015](https://blog.flat.io/smufl-and-new-music-font-on-flat/) we implemented [SMuFL](https://www.smufl.org/) (Standard Music Font Layout) in our music engraving engine and started using Bravura, a classic font developed by Steinberg and relesed under the [SIL Open Font License](/help/licenses/fonts-Bravura.txt).

In [February 2019 we added Petaluma to Flat](https://blog.flat.io/new-music-font/), a Handwritten music font, also developed and open sourced by Steinberg under the [SIL Open Font License](/help/licenses/fonts-Petaluma.txt).
