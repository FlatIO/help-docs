Inline comments are a powerful tool to **easily give contextualized feedback** on Flat's sheet music. They work in real-time across devices, and can even be used as simple reminders for your own work.

## Some use cases

Here are some use cases and examples when you can use inline comments.

As a teacher:

* Give live feedback with some context to your students during an assignment
* Tag students at a precise point in the correction of an assignment
* Give your students details of the evaluation grid directly on the music score

As an individual composer/arranger:

* Add a memo to a precise point you want to edit in your sheet music or tab
* Tag your friends/collaborators you previously invited for feedback/edits in a music score
* Share your approach and give details on the way you worked on a composition or arrangement

## How to add inline comments?

To add an inline comment, select one or multiple notes, then click on the comment icon next to the selection. A popover will be displayed on the score where you can add your comment.

**Tip**: You can insert new lines in your comment by pressing **Shift + Return**.

**Tip**: When you click on a comment card, your cursor will automatically be set to the beginning the highlighted zone on the score. And when your cursor is in a highlighted zone, the associated comment will be highlighted on the side of the screen.

## How to remove inline comments?

You can remove inline comments by resolving them. Under every comment you will see a "**Resolve comment**" button:

## Want to add global comments instead?

On **public scores**, you can give public comments on the scores instead of contextualized comments. If you own the score, open it by clicking on "*...*" next to a score [on the **My Library** page](/help/en/general/my-library.html), and choose "**View**".

If **you are a teacher and want to add global feedback** on a submission, on the review page of a student's work you have the possibility to give feedback. If you use an LMS like Google Classroom or Canvas, you can also add a comment in your LMS next to your student's submission.
