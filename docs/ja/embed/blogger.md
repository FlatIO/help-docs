Blogger allows you to embed any custom HTML code. That's a good opportunity to embed interactive sheet music on your own blog!

## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert the Flat score into your Blog, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy our HTML code

To copy the HTML code of our embed into your clipboard, go to the *My library* or the *Score Editor*, click on "*Share*" then choose "*Embed*", you will arrive on [our embed generator](https://flat.io/developers/embed/generator):

## 3. Insert the code into your Blogger post

To insert the notation into your Blogger blog post, click on "*HTML*", and paste the code where you want to insert it (e.g. at the end of the blog). Go back to compose to see the preview.
