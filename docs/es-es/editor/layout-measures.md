To customize the number of measures per system and notes, **open the Layout Settings, next to the print button**.

On our desktop web app, this is usually located on the right of your screen, or in the "Document" toolbar. On our mobile app, click on the edit button on the top of your screen.

## Measures settings

Under the **Measures** settings, you can now edit the **Number of measures per system** and the notes spacing.

**The number of measures is always a maximum**, this allows us to properly display all the measures, especially when they contain a lot of notes with small durations. You can also adjust the notes spacing combined with the number of measures per line to get the perfect result.

You might want to [add system breaks](/help/en/music-notation-software/system-break.html) to your notation to make the number of measure per system vary.
