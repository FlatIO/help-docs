To import your sheet music from any version of MuseScore or MuseScore.com on Flat, we advise you to use MusicXML or directly a MuseScore file (feature in beta).

## Import your MuseScore or MusicXML file on Flat

On Flat, go to [**My Library**](https://flat.io/my-library), then drag & drop your Musescore or MusicXML file. You can also click on the **Import a score or tab** button, or **New score or tab** and choose **Import your creation**:

Choose your file(s), and they will be directly added to your Flat account.

We believe in cloud reversibility, so at any time you [can export your scores back in MusicXML from Flat](/help/en/music-notation-software/print-export.html) and open them With MuseScore.
