Flat provides a mode to automatically color all the notes of your sheet music using the [Boomwhackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomwhacker) colors. This feature is available for all users using Flat Power and Flat for Education.

To enable this Boomwhackers colorization mode, click on the **Layout Settings** icon in the document toolbar, open the **Notes heads** settings and choose **Boomwhackers**. This will update all your existing notes with the Boomwhackers colors.
