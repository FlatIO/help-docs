You can use Flat to share your sheet music and collaborate in real-time with other people on your music notation projects. Start to choose [a privacy level for your creation](#privacy-levels--sharing-mode), then [invite other collaborators](#collaborate-or-share-a-score-with-someone). You can also [publish your scores on our platform](#publish-your-score-on-flat), or [embed them on other websites](#embed-your-score-on-another-website).

Sharing settings for a score can be adjusted on the *Library* page and in the *Editor*.

## Collaborate or share a score with someone

In the sharing settings, you can add multiple other Flat users to work with you on a score. You will be able **to edit the same document at the same time**, or separately if you want to. Three levels of permissions are available when sharing a score with someone:

* **Can read**: The other Flat user will be able to open the score and [use inline comments](/help/en/music-notation-software/inline-comments.html) to give feedback.
* **Can write**: The other Flat user will be able to edit the score, but won't be able to change the sharing settings or delete it.
* **Can admin**: The other Flat user will have complete access to the score, including changing sharing settings and deleting it.

## Privacy levels & Sharing mode

Every document on Flat has a privacy level that you can change on the *Library* page or the *Editor*. You can use the following privacy levels with any Flat account:

* **Private**: Only you can read and modify your score.
* **Private sharing link**: Similar to *private*, but the score will have a private and read-only link. You can disable and change this private link when you want, just make the score *private*.
* **Public**: Your sheet music is public on the Internet.

Only with a [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu) account:

* **Public in the organization**: Only the logged user from your School will have access to your sheet music in read-only.
