## How to add a new measure?

Most of the time when you input your notation, we automatically add new measure at the end of your score. But sometimes you need to insert a new one at the end of the document, or in the middle of the score. Go to the "**Measure**" toolbar and click on the "**+**" displayed on the left of the toolbar.

## How to remove a measure?

Put your cursor on the measure you want to remove or select the multiple measures that you want to remove. Go to the "**Measure**" toolbar and click on the "**-**" displayed on the left of the toolbar.
