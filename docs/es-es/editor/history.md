When you make changes to your music scores on [Flat](https://flat.io), we **automatically store every change you make**. With our history, you can browse the older versions of your creations, and if necessary, restore them at any modification that you want.

## Auto-save

Since December 2018, **you won't find a save button on Flat anymore**. No worries, **every single change is automatically synchronized to our servers**. We drastically improved the performance and reliability of the auto-save feature and how we now create new versions of your score. 

We display the **date of the last modification synchronized to our servers** on the top of the screen and create a full save of your document more often and faster than before (e.g., a few seconds after you stop working on a document). And **you can click on this last modification date to open the history** of your document.

## Differences between the free history and full version

The **free history allows** you to:

* Browse major version of your score (a major version is created every 50 modifications or less)
* Restore one of the 10 last major versions of your score (that's about the last 500 modifications of your score)

With the **full history** available with [Flat Power](https://flat.io/pricing) and [Flat for Education](https://flat.io/edu/pricing), you can:

* Browse major versions and every single change you made in your score, since the first note you added
* Easily see what change in the versions, and "rewind" or "replay" the changes
* Restore your score at any change you want

## Versions list

On the right of your screen, you have the **list of main versions** of your document, and **who made the changes** to the different versions. The colors next to the names are used to display the modifications on the score and are the same across the different versions.

The **small notes in green and red** next to a version indicate how many additions and deletions have been made in the version.

## Browse single modifications

When you are viewing a version of the document, you can see how this version has been made, and replay every single change:

* On the bottom of your screen, you will have a **slider to rewind and replay the different changes**. This one basically works like a video player.
* On the left of your score, you have **a minimal scrollbar that displays where the changes of the version are located**. This allows you to quickly jump and see what changed in the version.
* On the music notation, **the modifications are highlighted with different colors** corresponding to the people who worked on the version (listed on the right of your screen).
