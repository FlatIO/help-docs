Since March 2018, [Microsoft OneNote supports the embedding of a Flat music score](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Education-Blog/OneNote-supports-Flat-io-and-Screencast-plus-more-Class-Notebook/ba-p/168124), discover below how to embed your music score on OneNote. Please note that at this time, all the OneNote clients are supported, except OneNote 2016.

## 1. Create or import your sheet music on Flat

To insert your Flat score in your note, [you will need a Flat account if you don't have one](https://flat.io/auth/signup). You can then upload your score using a MusicXML or MIDI file, or directly create it online using our web-based music notation software. Check [out our dedicated help if you need more information](/help/en/music-notation-software/create-your-first-music-score.html).

## 2. Copy the music score link

To get the link to your sheet music, go to the *My library* or the *Score Editor*, click on *Share* and choose *Copy private shareable link*.
