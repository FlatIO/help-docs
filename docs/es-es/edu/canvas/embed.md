*You will need a Flat for Education account to use this feature, [check out the introduction](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/).*

[Once your Canvas course is configured to use Flat](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/setup-configuration.html), you can easily embed rich music notation on your pages, assignments content, and more. Every time you have a rich editor to create or edit content, you will see a Flat button available to embed or link your Flat score in your content:

From there, you will see your scores stored on Flat, and choose to either embed or link them. When creating content in Canvas, you will probably use the "**Embed**" or "**Link**" options, the ["**Use as template**" feature is mainly used to automatically gives copies of a score for an assignment](/help/en/education/canvas-lms/assignments.html).

Once you choose "**Embed**", you will get the score inserted directly into your Canvas page. Your students will be able to directly read, play, and even print the music notation without having to open Flat.
